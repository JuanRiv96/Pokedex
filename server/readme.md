# Pokedex API

Hello and thank you for being interested in this project which is an API that provides a list of 40 pokemons that you can filter, their specific details as well as a search engine and creator of custom pokemons.

### Steps and commands to execute. 

1.- As a first step, you must place the required environment variables in the .env file and consider that the default database in the configuration is PostgresSQL.
> You can use any database manager you want as long as you set the correct configuration. 

2.- Once you have everything configured, run the commands **npm install** to install the dependencies and **npm run dev** to run the application in development mode.

3.- Once the API starts, you can start consuming it from your frontend or perform the tests on each of the endpoints provided using Postman, Insomnia or the application you prefer.
